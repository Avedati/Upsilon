# Upsilon
Upsilon is a simple web scraper written in python 3, using urllib.request to access webpages and Tkinter for a GUI.

## Getting Started
To run Upsilon, you will need python 3, as well as urllib.request and Tkinter. Python 3 can be downloaded from the python 
website, or from your package manager if you are on a linux distribution. Both urllib and Tkinter can be installed using pip.

Once you have those three dependencies installed, type the following command into a terminal:
```
python3 main.py
```
